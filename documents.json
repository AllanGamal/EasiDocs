We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world.

In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements. VR helps students to learn chemistry without\nusing real materials and give more understanding of what are\n2www.haptx.com\n3www.unlimitedhand.com\n4www.katvr.com\n5www.virtuix.com\n6www.vrgochair.com\n484\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation. Learners can get new experiences without leaving\nthe classroom; for instance, they can swim with sharks,\n7www.melscience.com/vr\n8www.labster.com\n9www.immersivevreducation.com/apollo-11-vr/\n10www.play.google.com\n11www.play.google.com\n12www.unimersiv.com\n13www.oculus.com\n14www.steamcommunity.com\n15www.oculus.com\n16www.cafebazaar.ir/app/com.majazkadeh.animals/?l=enturn the classroom into a museum, visit outer space, and\nmore [38]. The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.

Studies\nhave revealed that (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have strong\npotentials for helping students to improve their skills and\nknowledge. In fact, bridging AR/VR and education can bring\nteaching and learning experiences in an attractive and effective\nway.\nIn this review paper, we initially present an introduction to and\na de\ufb01nition of AR/VR. We then brie\ufb02y study ongoing research\nand latest products in AR/VR, that have pedagogical values and\npotentials to improve educational systems. We then highlight the\ncapabilities and limitations of AR/VR to identify what AR/VR\ncan provide for learners and teachers.\nIndex Terms \u2014Augmented reality, Virtual reality, Education,\nTechnology, Opportunities, Challenges\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, technology has been growing fast and\nnoticeably in\ufb02uencing different aspects of life; our thinking,\nhabits, social activities, and lifestyle are all changed in differ-\nent ways compared to a few years ago. Regardless of positive\nand negative impacts of technology, a purpose of technology\nis typically to increase productivity in the industries, to ease\nlife, or to improve education. Accordingly, the development\nof education systems and learning methods is always a part of\nresearch programs, which includes the use of new technologies\nto take into account educational issues. Imperfections and\nchallenges in current education systems such as accessibility,\nfunding, autonomy, one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, and big changes\nin future jobs indicate teachers need to employ new methods\nfor improving education [1, 2, 3]. Integrating technology into\neducation allows to facilitate learning methods and improve\nlearning performance by creating and managing appropriate\ntechnological materials [4]. In addition, this integration pro-\nmotes students\u2019 skills to learn how to use new technologies\nin their future life. Jobs and future requirements change at\na fast speed, so students must be prepared to adapt to new\nenvironments and be proactive.\nEmerging and advanced technologies such as robotics, ar-\nti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and 3D printing\nare reshaping education systems. For instance, search engines\ncan answer a lot of questions that people might need to\nThe research was supported by the Iranian National Elites Foundation and\nIUST.memorize too much information to \ufb01nd solutions for them,\nso students need to learn to be differentiated from automated\nmachines. In this research, we address virtual reality (VR)\nand augmented reality (AR) technologies for improvements of\nlearning processes. In Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience that shows\nthe progression of learning experiences from the bottom of\nthe cone (learning by doing direct experiments) to the top of\nthe cone (learning through abstracts), learners involve more\nthe bottom rather than to be just spectators at the abstract\nlevel [5]. At the bottom, learners have opportunities to sense\nand understand their new knowledge in real life with learning\ncontexts. AR and VR technologies can be embedded at the\nlowest level of the cone; they can enrich environments where\nstudents can learn with the help from the most of their \ufb01ve\nsenses. Furthermore, students will be able to discover new\nknowledge, motivate to learn, develop their own experiences\nwith the help of AR/VR [6, 7]. In this research after the\nde\ufb01nitions of AR and VR in Section II, we present these\npotentials along with AR/VR products in Section III. Section\nIV provides a discussion on AR/VR and gives an overview\nof opportunities and challenges in the implementation of\nthese two technologies for learners and teachers. Finally, we\nconclude in Section V.\nII. D EFINITIONS\nAR and VR technologies are related but they are different\nthings. Before we begin to de\ufb01ne these terms precisely, \ufb01rst\nwe need to know what real andvirtual are. In Figure 1 which\npresented by Milgram et al. [8], the virtual environment and\nreal environment are two ends of a spectrum. Regardless of a\ncomplicated concept of reality in the philosophy, we consider\na real-world environment where it is limited to laws of physics\nand things in real-world can be sensed directly as they actually\nexist. In contrast, a virtual world is a computer-based simulated\nenvironment [9] which may or may not follow laws of physics\nsuch as time, gravity, material properties and so on. In a wider\nde\ufb01nition, participants are totally immersed in a virtual world\nthat synthesized by computers. In contrast, participants are\ndirectly presented in the real world [8]. The spectrum between\nreal and virtual environment was called Reality-Virtuality (RV)\ncontinuum [8] and the different types of AR or VR can be\nplaced on this continuum. Schnabel et al.

As illustrated in Figure 2, from the left\nto right, the degree of reality decreases; so a more detailed\nclassi\ufb01cation of AR and VR is shown on the continuum\nbased on their attributes, activities, and designs. Although this\nFig. 2. A different classi\ufb01cation ranging from the real environment to the\nvirtual environment [10]\nclassi\ufb01cation is more precise, most products in AR/VR do not\napply this terminology. Therefore, we address research and\nproducts according to a more general framework. In Figure\n3, the RV continuum is divided into two main subcategories\nAR and VR technologies; it is more convenient to study the\nresearch in the literature.\nFig. 3. A general representation for AR and VR classi\ufb01cation\nA. AR (augmented reality)\nAccording to the framework that is shown in Figure 3, AR\ncan be de\ufb01ned as an interactive experience in the real world\nenvironment where the computer-generated information and\nelements are linked to the real world. The computer-generated\ninformation is virtual content that is synthesized with the\nhelp of multiple sensors (i.e., camera, microphone, GPS) and\nhaptic devices. The AR productions can take place in three\nsteps: \ufb01rst, all real-world data is collected by various sensors.\nSecond, this information is then analyzed and additional\ninformation from different information sources. Finally, the\ngained information is displayed as digital elements.B. VR (virtual reality)\nIn contrast to AR, VR takes place within an arti\ufb01cial\nenvironment and a participant becomes a part of this arti\ufb01cial\nworld as an immersive or a non-immersive member. The\npeople can interact and manipulate computer-generated objects\nin a virtual environment with the help of some gadgets like\nhaptic devices. In addition, VR gadgets have in\ufb02uenced VR\ncontent and enhances VR capabilities for better experiences.\nFor instance, smell, wind, sounds, heat, body movement detec-\ntion are elements that potentially create VR experiences more\nreal and interesting.\nIII. AR/VR P RODUCTS\nIn the literature, AR/VR products tend to create new ex-\nperiences in several \ufb01elds, from education to games. Here,\nwe studied VR/AR products in two categories: hardware and\nsoftware.\nA. AR/VR hardware\nVR and AR technologies need to mix real environment\ninformation and computer-generated objects properly to create\ndesirable experiences but participants never are able to have a\nperfect feeling of VR/AR content without tools and gadgets.\nThe AR/VR tools work based on human perceptions and can\nengage the several human senses. The tools can be visual,\nauditory, haptic, olfactory devices and the external devices like\nposition system can incorporate in these tools.\nThe visual perception in VR can be done either by a\nhead-mounted display (HMD), in a space with back-projected\nstereo projection screens around (e.g., CA VE1), or a desktop\ndisplay. An HMD is a box worn on the head and consists\nof a one or two small displays in front of one or each eye.\nThe Google Cardboard is a low-cost HMD developed by\nGoogle [11]. A smartphone is placed into the back of lenses\nto present content to viewers. This cardboard is also linked\nto a software development kit (SDK) that provide a designing\nplatform to simply produce VR content for the Android and\niOS operating systems. The HTC Vive, Sony PlayStation VR,\nand Samsung Gear VR are other HMD products that are\nmostly targeted for games and entertainment purposes (Table\nI). In education, price, quality, and user-friendly are important\nfactors for student use. The Google Cardboard seems to be a\ngood choice for education but the quality of a display is also\ncan be taken into account. Because, side effects of VR such\nas dizziness and eye fatigue may encourage students to use\nbetter ones, therefore the expensive HMD may be considered\nfor education. The HMD is also developed for AR applica-\ntions. AR HMDs look like eyeglass with components such\nas camera, IMU, microphone. Users see a real environment\noptically and computer-generated elements appear on the glass\nsimultaneously. Although AR HMDs are relatively costly for\neducation but it can revolutionize classrooms by presenting\n3D models and other interesting demonstrations (Table I).\n1Cave automatic virtual environment\n483\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

For instance, CA VE is an immersive virtual\nreality environment and takes place inside a room whose walls,\nceil and \ufb02oor may have projection screens. Users typically\ninteract through input devices such as joysticks or gloves with\nvirtual objects on the screens. CA VE can be a suitable choice\nfor education because a number of students can experience VR\nonce. It can decrease the cost of a school (not individual) in\nrespect to HMDs and can help a teacher to conduct all students\nduring experiments but users cannot move around freely.\nThe CA VE or HMDs are still inaccessible and expensive\nfor teachers and students. Desktop VR is a low-cost visual\nperception that can be easily applied by users; the users just\nneed to watch a desktop computer monitor and interact with\nVR objects by a controlling device (i.e., a computer mouse)\n[12, 13].\nVR cabins are usually simulators that look like CA VE but\nthey can provide motions in the three axes. These cabins are\nbasically employed in education and job training, for instance,\ncockpit simulator for pilot training [14], vehicle simulator for\ndriver training [15] and so on.\nThe haptic technology allows to produce more attractive\nVR content; haptic devices can reconstruct and simulate the\neffects of real force feedback phenomena in VR. For instance,\nTeslasuit is wearable in which haptic feedback system is\nembedded; it covers the entire body and transfer hits and\nstrikes to body [16]. Gloves and other small wearable devices\nwere presented to make touch feeling and transfers the force tohands (i.e., HaptX2, unlimitedhand3). Handling users\u2019 motions\nin minimal physical space causes to develop a walking system\nfor virtual worlds (i.e., KATVR4, virtuix5, vrgochair6).\nB. AR/VR software\nDuring the last few decades, several AR/VR applications\nhave been produced to be used in several \ufb01elds such as adver-\ntisement, tourism, maintenance, and training. In the education\n\ufb01elds, applications have been developed for adoption AR/VR\ninto learning processes and attractive ones were presented\nin mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and other scien-\nti\ufb01c subjects. In physics, virtual electricity and Newton labs\nwere presented by Zspace to learn electricity concepts and\ntroubleshooting circuits. Newtons Park was designed to teach\nNewtonian Mechanics by building simulations and interacting\nwith data. Moreover, zSpace applications support teaching a\nwide range of learning objectives from learning Newton laws\nto learn anatomy [17]. The Hololens was used to show heat\nconduction of metals for an introductory laboratory course in\nthermodynamics [18]. Chemistry lab may include dangerous\nexperiments which may happen when a student combine\nwrong elements.

Real chem-\nical components were also replaced with virtual ones with the\nhelp of AR technology and more tangible interaction in real\nenvironment was provided for learner [20, 21]. In astronomy,\nricher AR/VR content were introduced than other \ufb01elds. The\nstudies have shown that students misunderstand some concepts\nin astronomy [22] and some of these misconceptions have\nremained for several years [23]. AR/VR astronomy products\naim to change conventional teaching methods and content, then\nhelp students to clarify their misconceptions. DVREMS was\ndesigned to teach earth motion in elementary school students\n[12]. Mintz et al. [24] presented a dynamic 3D model of the\nsolar system and learners travel through it. In the literature,\nsimilar VR content were presented to enhance astronomical\nknowledge in students [25, 26, 27, 28]. In addition, the\ncommercial applications were presented, for instance, Apollo\n119, Astronomy VR10, and Star Chart11. The AR technology\nhelps students to understand some astronomy concepts as\nwell, for instance, relationships between planets [29]. Fleck\nand Simon [30] compared AR and physical astronomical\nmodels for learner. They highlighted that AR learning methods\nimproved signi\ufb01cantly astronomical learning than physical\nlearning method. Reed et al. [31] designed a new sandbox\nthat mixed with AR to explain gravity. AR/VR tours and\njourneys were attractive parts of these technologies that en-\nhanced historical and geographical knowledge of students. For\ninstance, students just need to turn on their VR HMD and then\ntravel to ancient Iran, Rome, or Egypt (i.e., unimersiv12) [32].\nIn addition, the learners can virtually travel to oceans, visit\nother countries to familiar with other cultures and so on (i.e.,\nGoogle earth VR13, destinations14). The AR technology was\nalso used in museums and heritage places to help visitors and\nlearners with additional information simultaneously on objects\nor visiting places [33, 34]. In biology and anatomy subjects,\nVR was used to train surgeons and to improve their level of\ncompetence before they operate on real patients [35]. Travel\ninside the human body (i.e., body VR15) and representing\n3D models of organs [36] can reshape learning processes.\nAR in Human Anatomy Atlas 2018 Edition was a perfect 3D\nanatomy reference for learning in the healthcare system [37].\nAR can provide additional information on books. The\nexperiments, videos, and other materials can be shown since\na device is placed in front of pages of books, posters,\n\ufb02ashcards (i.e., PAMPAM \ufb02ashcards16). Google Expeditions\nis an immersive education application that was designed for\neducation.

The Google also provides a package to support\nAR/VR. The Google Cardboard as a cheap HMD, Google\nJump to produce 3D-360 video with cameras, Google VR to\nvisit places, and provide a platform for developers to build\nVR content. The researchers and companies are developing\nplatforms for AR/VR developers to facilitate production of\nAR and VR content. Google VR provides SDKs (software\ndevelopment kit) allowing to build new VR content. These\nSDKs are available for the Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal that\nallow developers to produce VR content for several platforms\n[11]. The SDKs (i.e., google VR, GOpenVR, and SteamVR)\nmay be linked with the game engines to create 3D elements\nand environments for AR/VR. ARCore17is a platform for\nproducing AR content. It detects images and track the position\nof the camera relative to the world. Then it builds models\non the images [11]. ARToolKit, Vuforia, Wikitude, EasyAR,\nand DeepAR are similar SDKs that are employed for AR\nproduction.\nIV. O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nResearch has revealed that AR/VR technologies are highly\nbene\ufb01cial to education and could help students to develop their\nskills and knowledge in a more effective way [39, 40, 41]\nAR/VR systems could present educational content in attractive\nways and enhance students motivation and interest. Not only\nstudents enjoy from AR/VR learning but also they follow\nlearning processes and then AR/VR systems help them to\nachieve more accurate knowledge [13, 42]. AR/VR systems\nprovide a better understanding of educational dif\ufb01culties that\nhave been addressed in the educational literature [43]. For\ninstance, some students cannot perceive 3D models or some\nstudents cannot imagine invisible phenomena such as the spin-\nning of the earth [44, 45]. AR/VR allows learners to see 3D\nmodels, to manipulate objects virtually, to \ufb01gure out unobserv-\nable phenomena, to experience abstract concepts (e.g., travel\nin wormholes). These virtual experiences can deeply promote\nstudents thinking [46] and correct their misconceptions [42].\nRecent progress in AR/VR hardware allows the interaction\nand integration between several senses and an around envi-\nronment with the help of multi-sensory devices. The sensory\nintegration provides learners to construct meaning from ex-\nperiences [13]. The importance of collaborative learning in\ndistant has been already stated in the literature [47]. The VR\ntechnology potentially provides instant communication and\nstudents can attend in a virtual classroom at the same time.\nThey can discuss, receive immediate comments from others\nand feel a sense of being in the same places as their classmates\n[48].\nAR/VR products help students to overcome learning bar-\nriers and improve students\u2019 knowledge, skills, thinking, and\nunderstanding. However, there are challenges and drawbacks\nto apply AR/VR as an educational tool in the most classrooms\nin the world. The \ufb01rst problem is the cost of implementing\n17www.developers.google.com/ar/\n485\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Chalmers University of Technology Sweden.

        "page_content": "AR/VR systems. As we have seen, HMDs are relatively\nexpensive. In other cases, computers and display systems for\ndemonstrating the VR/AR products are also needed that may\nmake a challenge for many schools. The second challenge is a\nlack of realism in VR or AR simulations. Quality of graphics\ndisplay impresses a feeling of a user, it can improve visual\nperception and provide a richer experience [49, 50]. The third\nchallenge is health issues and physical effects on students.\nHMDs are relatively heavy that may cause wearers feel fatigue\nafter a long period of time. Lenses in an HMD may obstruct\nthe view, although they are close to the eye in modern versions.\nAnother side effect that is not limited to HMDs is simulator\nsicknesses and it appears mostly on VR experiences. The\nsimulator sickness usually results from mismatching between\nthe visual perception and sense of movement. Symptoms of\nsimulator sickness may include nausea, disorientation, and\ndiscomfort [13]. Fourth challenge is inherited from hardware\nlimitations. Although recent hardware developments have im-\nproved AR and VR demonstrations, the limitations may avoid\nhaving a great level of user experiences. Lack of precision,\nGPS errors and navigation problems, latency between sensors\u2019\ndata and the effects to the visual system are common problems\nthat can cause students\u2019 frustration and interruption to their\nexperiences.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have attempted to show the capabilities\nand limitations of AR and VR technologies for education.\nTechnologies progress fast and impress our lifestyles. Re-\nsearchers are interested in addressing the issues and drawbacks\nof education systems with the help of potentials of emerging\ntechnologies and the latest scienti\ufb01c achievements. AR/VR\nsystems provide opportunities to increase students\u2019 motiva-\ntions and engage them more in learning processes. In addition,\nAR/VR allows the students to have virtual experiences where\ntraditional learning methods are impossible or expensive.\nHowever, there are still some challenges for AR/VR to be\nused by most learners in the world. These technologies are in\ntheir infancy but they have a great potential to overcome the\nbarriers.\nREFERENCES\n[1]D. Teferra and P. G.
